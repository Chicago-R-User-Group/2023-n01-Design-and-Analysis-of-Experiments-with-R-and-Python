## Introduction 

In an era of big data where we love to "boil the ocean" with giant models with tons of parameters and gazillions of rows, we should take a little time to examine how we can do more with less, and have more (statistically) powerful insights in the process. Design and Analysis of Experiments allows us to use designed experiments to quickly gain insight over parameter importance and interactions, and learn more about how and why we should vary our parameters for more robust out of sample solutions.

## Sponsors

[PyData Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/pydatachi/) and [The Chicago R User Group (CRUG)](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-r-user-group/) co-host this event.
